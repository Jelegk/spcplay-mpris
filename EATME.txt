This script implements an mpris listener to control a running spcplay.exe (2.21+) (through Wine)


TODO:
 - Fill README
          └ Dependencies (apt, wine, mpris_server.hpp which itself needs sdbus-c++)
          └ Setup (where to place files)
              └ .desktop icon? mimelist entries?
          └ Example (screenshot)
 - include libspctag?
 - links (spcplay, wine, mpris_server, https://github.com/Kistler-Group/sdbus-cpp/)
 - use https://github.com/ullenius/spctag instead of libspctag?
